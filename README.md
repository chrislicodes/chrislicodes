# Hello Hello! ðŸ‘€

I'm Chris, nice to meet you ðŸ‘‹

I enjoy working on frontend-related stuff and found some time for side projects this year. I am currently diving into WebGL and will probably write about some fun experiments.

Future Chris will then add some links to my recent blog posts for my non-existent-but-in-planning future blog here. ðŸ˜¬
